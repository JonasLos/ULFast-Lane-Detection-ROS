# PreTrained Models
Download the pretrained model from https://github.com/cfzd/Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection repository.
Then create a "models" folder in the /lane_detection_catkin_ws/src/lane_detection and /Ultrafast-Lane-Detection-Inference-Pytorch- directories and then save both the .pth files in the models folder.
